# WinXP-Icons
### This icon pack is a remake of the classic YlmfOS theme with some mods for icons to scale right

- All icons now scaling allright and some more icons included!

#  

This version downloaded from https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-XP in June 2019 and slightly modified so that different document and image types show with different icons.  A few other icons have been added or reassigned. 

It has only been tested, and not very thoroughly, on Debian Stretch running the Mate desktop.

# INSTALLATION

Click the green "Clone or download button" then Download ZIP.  When this has downloaded open it and extract the Windows-XP-master directory to ~/.icons; you may have to press Ctrl-h to make it show in your file manager.

Now open the Mate Control Centre and click Appearance and choose the TraditionalOK theme.  Then click Customise followed by the Window Border tab and choose WinMe.  Now click the Icons tab and choose WinXP.


# SUPPORT

There isn't any.  I did this for my own use but am happy to share it with anybody else who wants it.  However I don't really know what I am doing and am not going to even attempt to test it on multiple combinations of distros and desktops.
