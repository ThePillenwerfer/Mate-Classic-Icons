# Classic Windows Icons for the Mate Desktop

#  

This version downloaded from https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-XP in June 2019 and slightly modified so that different document and image types show with different icons.  A few other icons have been added, changed or reassigned. 

It has only been tested on Debian Stretch running the Mate desktop.  I haven't deliberately removed functionality for other desktops but may have done so by accident.

# INSTALLATION

Click the green "Clone or download button" then Download ZIP.  When this has downloaded open it and extract the Windows-XP-master directory to ~/.icons; you may have to press Ctrl-h to make it show in your file manager.

Now open the Mate Control Centre and click Appearance and choose the TraditionalOK theme.  Then click Customise followed by the Window Border tab and choose WinMe.  Now click the Icons tab and choose WinXP.

Most icons will change immediately but a few, such as those in the Notification Area, only will after a reboot.


# SUPPORT

There isn't any.  I did this for my own use but am happy to share it with anybody else who wants it.  However I don't really know what I am doing and am not going to even attempt to test it on multiple combinations of distros and desktops.
