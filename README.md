# WinXP-Icons
### This icon pack is a remake of the classic YlmfOS theme with some mods for icons to scale right

- All icons now scaling allright and some more icons included!



This version downloaded from https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-XP in June 2019 and slighly modified so that word processor documents, PDFs and ePubs all show with different icons. 

It has only been tested on Debian Stretch running the Mate desktop.

# INSTALLATION

Click the green Clone or download button then Download ZIP.  When this has downloaded open it an extract the Windows-XP-master directory to ~/.icons; you may have to press Ctrl-h to make it show in your file manager.

Now open the Mate Control Centre and click Appearance then Customise followed by the Icons tab.  This will bring up a list which should now include WinXP.  Click that.
